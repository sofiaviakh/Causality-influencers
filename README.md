# Causality-influencers
This project is part of the Digital Causality Lab at the ISA-Zentrum, Hamburg University.
In this project, we aim to analyze the perceived trust and effectiveness of virtual influencer endorsements compared to those of human influencers.
Virtual influencers are computer-generated personalities developed using AI and CGI technologies. Their purpose is to create social media content and build a follower base.
It is still a debated topic whether social media users can positively perceive virtual influencers and, therefore, be influenced by their promotional endorsements. While some academic scholars believe that humans can regard virtual personalities as legitimate influencers, others argue that consumers may reject them due to their incomprehensible or artificial nature.
Therefore, our research aims to examine the differences in perceived trust between virtual and human influencers, based on a survey conducted on the campus of Hamburg University. The goal is to better understand how students perceive virtual influencers and whether their endorsements increase purchase intention.
